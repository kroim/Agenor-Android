# Core module for agenor light wallets.

This is a java wrapper library for Agenor. Share common Agenor code between different apps/projects to prevent WET code and make things more DRY. Mainly in the context of light wallets. In the future this could be extended to a full implementation of Agenor node in java. But as this would be a huge endeavour and have many things in the route map already don't expect it in the near future - but PRs are accepted ;-)
